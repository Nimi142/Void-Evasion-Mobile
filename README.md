 ### The Game

 In the game, the player needs to avoid falling into the void (hence "Void Evasion"). It's done by jumping between the generated platforms. The player can start to jump as long as they stand on a platform, they can continue to jump by pressing the space bar for as long as they want as long as they do not pass the height of the screen or stop jumping. When the player does pass the height of the screen, they will stop accelerating and a red bar will come out and push the player back onto the proper height.
Each platform that is being passed correlates to a new coin being earned.
- The game can be paused by clicking on the pause icon in the upper right corner of the screen. In the pause menu:
    - The player can unpause by clicking continue or x.
    - Open the settings, who function like they do in the main menu.
    - Restart by clicking on the restart button.
    - Quit to the main menu by clicking on the Quit button.
- In death, a prompt appears. In the prompt:
    - The score of the current run represented as Score: AMOUNT.
    - The highest score ever achieved by the player, represented as Highscore:\n CROWN AMOUNT.
    - A button with a green circular arrow to restart that can also be activated by pressing anywhere on the screen.
    - A button with a blue home icon on it to return to the main menu.
