 ### The Game
 In the game, the player needs to avoid falling into the void (hence "Void Evasion"). It's done by jumping between the generated platforms. The player can start to jump as long as they stand on a platform, they can continue to jump by pressing the space bar for as long as they want as long as they do not pass the height of the screen or stop jumping. When the player does pass the height of the screen, they will stop accelerating and a red bar will come out and push the player back onto the proper height.
Each platform that is being passed correlates to a new coin being earned.
- The game can be paused ny pressing p and un-paused by pressing p or pressing space. In the pause menu:
    - The player can unpause by clicking continue or x.
    - Restart by clicking on the restart button.
    - Quit to the main menu by clicking on the Quit button.
- In death, a prompt appears. In the prompt:
    - The score of the current run, represented as Score: AMOUNT.
    - The highest score ever achieved by the player, represented as CROWN AMOUNT.
    - A green button with an arrow to restart that can also be pressed by pressing on the space bar.
    - A blue button with a home icon on it to return to the main menu.

If you have read all this, you are supposed to have full mastery of the game's mechanics.
I wish you good luck and some very big high-scores.
